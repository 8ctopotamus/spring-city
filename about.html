<h2>About Spring City Garden Club</h2>

<p>SCGC members gather on the third Thursday of each month beginning with the club’s 9:30 a.m. social time where we make new friends and connect with current friends. Typically, there is a business meeting held after the presenter or activity is complete. During this meeting we discuss and vote on important issues that pertain to club activities.</p>

<p>Most meetings take place on the second floor of Citizens Bank located at 2109 Corporate Drive in Waukesha (Hwy 59 and Center Road).  At monthly meetings we share information and learn new ideas about gardening, environmental preservation and beautification from guest experts (speakers). Please see our calendar for this year’s agenda. Light refreshments are served by members who take turns. The fellowship and camaraderie with people who share like values and interests are priceless.</p>
